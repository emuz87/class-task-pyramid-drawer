# class-task-pyramid-drawer

Two programs which accomplish roughly the same task. **Program 1** is more compact whilst **Program 2** is more practical.

## Comparisons
### Validation
Program 1 uses recursion for validation (which does not catch all errors resulting from input)
Program 2 uses subclasses of a validation superclass for validation (this should catch all errors resulting from input; I think)

### Drawing the result
Both programs use the same method to draw the pyramid; Program 1 has it on one line while Program 2 splits it across multiple for heightened readability (somewhat)
